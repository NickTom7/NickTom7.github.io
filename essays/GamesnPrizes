## Play the game correctly.... or not?
Stack Overflow is a great resource for software engineers to have! Not only can you ask a question there, you can also help others with theirs or simply learn from them. However, not all questions get answers. In fact, some questions even get replies that boarderline cyber bullying. To avoid this, your question should be as simple as can be while still conveying your ideas. An example of this would be like: [TechFolios](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8318911/why-does-html-think-chucknorris-is-a-color). "Why does HTML think “chucknorris” is a color?". Despite how weird or funny the question may sound, it is a valid question. While providing this person's question, he also left a description along with examples of the reason behind his question. As a result, this person has recieved replies that have been upvoted several thousand times.
