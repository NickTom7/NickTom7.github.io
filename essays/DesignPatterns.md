## E63 Design Patterns
Ever seen reused/recycled code? is it copyright, plagiarism or just common knowledge? To me, its all the above! Formerly, design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems. For example, a simple switch function. Three variables: A, B, Temp. To switch A and B, let Temp = A, A = B and B = A. For a simple, yet effective way of switching data within variables, why change it? Someone once said "Why fix what's not broken" (I don't know the original creator of that quote). Similarly, larger functions that work may need to be tinkered to fit more specific designs, but if it works towards the same goal, why not use it?

One good example of design patterns we see in coding nowdays is Apple and Android. While Apple made a business decision and spend their time and money in marketing, Android was busy spending their resources into research. It is obvious that the two companies are competitors, but when and where do we draw the line on copyright?
