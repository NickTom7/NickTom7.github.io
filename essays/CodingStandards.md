## E28 Reflect On Coding Standards

	Eslint alongside IntelliJ are both very useful tools in learning Javascript. Some useful tools they offer include things like color coding function, variables, objects and so forth. Unlike other IDEs, IntelliJ allows users to distinguish between key words, numbers and even strings. IntelliJ also allows for interaction with Github via Github Desktop. Instead of using command lines and keys to push projects into your Github repository, you can commit and push it through Github Desktop. After initial setup, this process is much easier to use in my opinion. Eslint is a cool feature of IntelliJ that is basically a spell/grammar check for your coding. If your code has problems with compiling, Eslint will display the errors and how to fix them. Sometimes Eslint will also offer to fix the errors for you. This is like having auto-correct on your phones.
