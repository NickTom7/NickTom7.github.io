## E28 Reflect On Coding Standards
Eslint alongside IntelliJ are both very useful tools in learning Javascript. Some useful tools they offer include things like color coding function, variables, objects and so forth. Unlike other IDEs, IntelliJ allows users to distinguish between key words, numbers and even strings. IntelliJ also allows for interaction with Github via Github Desktop. Instead of using command lines and keys to push projects into your Github repository, you can commit and push it through Github Desktop. After initial setup, this process is much easier to use in my opinion. Eslint is a cool feature of IntelliJ that is basically a spell/grammar check for your coding. If your code has problems with compiling, Eslint will display the errors and how to fix them. Sometimes Eslint will also offer to fix the errors for you. This is like having auto-correct on your phones.

Some questions do not always get responses. Users of Stack Overflow are more inclined to answer questions that are challenging or something that is not that easy to look up. In other words, the question needs to appeal to the reader. In this example, the person named their question: ["Hi.I can not make a slider by using Glide.js in react? Please help me"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73655613/hi-i-can-not-make-a-slider-by-using-glide-js-in-react-please-help-me). Unlike the other question before, this question uses the description to put their code down. As a result, no one has answered this question and got downvoted twice.

Overall, anyone can answer any question. If you search around Stack Overflow, there is a trend that you can see from people who ask these types of questions. Most of the questions you see that can be searched up, would not be answered. Once in a while some kind hearted person will come around and answer them. In order to ask a decent question on Stack Overflow, you would want to give as much detail as you can while appealing to the responder.
