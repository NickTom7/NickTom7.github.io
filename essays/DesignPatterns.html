<h2 id="e63-design-patterns">E63 Design Patterns</h2>
<p>Ever seen reused/recycled code? is it copyright, plagiarism or just common knowledge? To me, its all the above! Formerly, design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems. For example, a simple switch function. Three variables: A, B, Temp. To switch A and B, let Temp = A, A = B and B = A. For a simple, yet effective way of switching data within variables, why change it? Someone once said “Why fix what’s not broken” (I don’t know the original creator of that quote). Similarly, larger functions that work may need to be tinkered to fit more specific designs, but if it works towards the same goal, why not use it?</p>

<p>One good example of design patterns we see in coding nowdays is Apple and Android. While Apple made a business decision and spend their time and money in marketing, Android was busy spending their resources into research. It is obvious that the two companies are competitors, but when and where do we draw the line on copyright? Over time, Android released new features that Apple put forward shortly after. It is not to my knowledge that Apple “copied” their designs, but there is much evidence that points to it. For example, lockscreens, widgets and keyboards. Is there a patten to code or will we see this more in the future? I’m not complaining, as long as I get to use all these features, thats all that matters to a consumer like me.</p>

<p>Design patterns to me is the integration and advancement of everything coding. Open source softwares are literally built upon this. With the technological world continuing to evolve, the main structures of coding are bound to become reoccuring. If microsoft builds a PS6, they’re not going to start from scratch, they’re going to build off the PS5 and make improvements. Following this example, I’ve realized no matter what programming language you use, everything stems off of one another. It’s like letters of a language! During my time learning Java, many things were based off of each other. Learning CSS, we used predefined bootstrap code as well as meteor templates. Design patters are bound to occur anywhere and everywhere. It would actually surprise me if there were technology in this day that does not use any design patterns at all.</p>
