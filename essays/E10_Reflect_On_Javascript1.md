## E10 Reflect On Javascript 1
Although I have used javascrit before, this is my first time formally learning it. I really do appreciate this tutorial as it gives me insight on things I did not know about. Prior to this, I knew java was easier to use with shortcuts but I did not know what they were. Firstly, "let" and "const" was a new way of defining things. When I say things, I mean versatile things like numbers, strings or even functions. I was in store for how easy this made me feel once I saw this.

Upon learning new things, not all were appealing to me. Arrow functions in particular were one thing that took me a while to understand. Due to this, ost likely, I will continue useing regualar function calls "function name()" moving forward. Other operations that can still be typed normally like objects are also things I will keep from what I know. Applying what I've learned from this tutorial, I do think Java is an excellent programming language and I understand now why everyone preffers to use it.

Athletic software engineering is VERY stressful to me. Even though completing WODs or any coding gives me satisfaction, being timed does not make me feel comfortable. Recently, while I've been doing WODs, I noticed that I try to type too fast and in return leads me to making a syntax error. Overall, I do think software engineering helps me get better at coding (and probably forces me to type more accurately too). Maybe in the future, I'll switch sides and think this'll actually be fun, but for now its just stressful.
