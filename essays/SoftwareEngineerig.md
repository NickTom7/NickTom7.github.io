One of the most fastest advancing things in the world right now is technology. As technology becomes more advanced, devices are getting smaller, coding is becoming as essential as learning a language, and it's taking over our employment. Software engineering to me is more than just coding. Software engineering is being able to communicate to machine devices. Technology exists mainly for convinience and to make human life easier. By being able to communicate with these machines, we can futher advance or produce more functionality out of them.

One thing I am interested in is simply the thought of fabricating anything I can think of! For example, as a tennis player and as someone who has worked at a sports shop, I'va had to string many rackets. The racket stringer comes with clamps and a user defined weight. Weaving strings over and over again starts to hurt your fingers especially with polyester or jagged strings. I wanted to create a machine that can string rackets for me. One problem I ran into is different racket shapes and holes. Hopefully in the future I can come up with solutions to counter these problems in the future.

In the future, hopefuly I dont have to work alone. In fact, I hope to get more experience working on projects as a team so I can get other prospectives and opinions on how to solve something. I am open to learning more computer languages as well. I strongly believe software engineering is going to become a big part of society such that schools will start to teach coding to students in grade school. When that time comes, I would gladly offer myself to help the yougsters learn what I did in my time here.
